# college-mobileListing
Mobile phone catalogue website.<br> 
This was one my college projects and my first attempt at trying to build something in web.
The website is a catalogue of all the latest(at the time) mobile phones in the market and makes it easy to search,find,compare,view specs 
of the many different models of mobile phones available in the market at a single place.
We've used XML files to store the data related to phones.

Teammates: Alok ([@alokg1019](http://https://github.com/abhi9419)) , Parag and Nadeem.

PS : Just backing up the project now, since we didn't know git at the time :P
